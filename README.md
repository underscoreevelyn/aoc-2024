yeah i decided to use a template because i wanted to use rust and i couldn't be assed to write my own template.

 i'm gonna upload this to github and i'm not sure that the way i did my git will indicate that this is a fork... but it is. it's taken from [here](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust) (without credit). see `LICENSE` for the license for his shit, all mine is public domain

i found this a *lot* easier than last year, strangely. i ended up going to reddit for hints only 4 times, and only outright stole code once. not sure if the topics this year were just a bit easier, or if i'm more talented; probably the former, let's be honest. i can also now very confidently say that i like rust more than javascript, which is very exciting! i can sit on the sidelines and laugh at people fighting the borrow checker like i'm any better >:3
